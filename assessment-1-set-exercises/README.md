# S1: Set Exercises

## Repository Info
A folder has been provided for each Set Exercise. Each folder contains the files you will need for that exercise. You should start by reading the `README` file first. This will be easier to do if you open your GitHub repository in Visual Studio Code.

Your solution to exch exercise should be well organised, appropriately named, and easy to find.

**Only code pushed to your GitHub repository before the assessment deadline will be marked. Ensure you give yourself enough time before your final push.**

## The Brief
Your task is to code solutions to a series of set exercises that will test your knowledge of fundamental web development techniques. The exercises can be found in your Web Dev I GitHub repository. Each exercise focuses on a different topic taught in class to allow you to put into practice what you have learned. 

* **[Exercise 1](exercise-1-semantic-markup)**: Semantic Markup
* **[Exercise 2](exercise-2-css-styling)**: CSS Styling
* **[Exercise 3](exercise-3-rich-media)**: Rich Media
* **[Exercise 4](exercise-4-web-accessibility)**: Web Accessibility

*You must attempt all exercises in order to pass the assessment.*

Each exercise is worth 25 marks. 20 marks are available for the correct use of the techniques described in the exercise. 5 marks are available for repository presentation, helpful commenting, and the correct use of coding conventions. Your mark for the assessment will be calculated by adding together your mark for each exercise.

Over the course of the module, you should keep your repository well organised. You should create a new folder for each exercise, which is clearly named and easy to find (e.g. 01-html-fundamentals). You should commit changes in your repository often (e.g. after completing each exercise), use descriptive commit messages, and regularly push your code back to GitHub.
