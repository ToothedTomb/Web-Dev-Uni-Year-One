<p>Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of
     classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, 
     a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure 
     Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word 
     in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 
     1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero,
      written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the 
      Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line 
      in section 1.10.32.</p>
<p>The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested. 
    Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are also 
    reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 
    translation by H. Rackham.</p>
<p>There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have 
    suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don't 
    look even slightly believable. If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need 
    to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the Lorem 
    Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this 
    the first true generator on the Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined 
    with a handful of model sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. The 
    generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition, injected humour, or 
    non-characteristic words etc.</p>
<p>It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page 
    when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less 
    normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it 
    look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem 
     as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in 
     their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on 
     purpose (injected humour and the like).</p>
