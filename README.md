# Web Dev I

## Repository info

This is your GitHub repository for Web Dev I.

Over the course of the module, you should keep your repository well organised. You should commit changes in your repository often (e.g. after completing a specific task), use descriptive commit messages, and regularly push your code back to GitHub.

A folder has been provided for each assessment, which will contain any additional files you may need to complete that assessment. You should submit your work for each assessment inside the folder for that assessment. You can keep your in-class work in this repository too.
